## Website of a home appliance repair company
##### Website: <https://союзчестныхмастеров.рф/>

### Python & Django

This project would have been done in a hurry, literally in a couple of days, for my daughter, who opened her own home appliance repair company. The project will be finalized as her business develops, so some of the lines have been commented out for the future.

There is not much backend yet, because the site has few tasks at the moment, too, and for receiving orders it will transfer customers to Telegram, where the order will be accepted and processed by a robot, which I plan to write in a couple of days. In the near future, in addition to the Telegram robot, I will write more Whatsapp and VK robots. The site database and the robot database will be the same, so as not to split up the order storage location and have all the statistics.

The front end was made on the constructor and exported to HTML. Based on these files, I made site templates and used fonts and styles.

At its core, it is a business card website.
